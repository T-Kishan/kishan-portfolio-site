      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p class="about-intro">
        Hi, I'm Kishan. I’m someone who’s always been curious about how things work — especially when it comes to technology. I love the feeling of building something from scratch and seeing it come to life, whether it’s a web app, a small automation script, or a design prototype.
      </p>
      <p class="about-intro">
        What excites me most about IT is its power to solve real problems and make a difference in people’s lives. I’m drawn to full-stack development because it lets me work on both the logic and the user experience — I want to create software that’s not just functional, but also delightful to use.
      </p>
      <p class="about-intro">
        My goal is to keep learning, keep experimenting, and keep building things that matter. Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring new tech, sketching out app ideas, and collaborating with others who share the same drive to create.
